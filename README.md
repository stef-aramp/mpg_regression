supervised machine learning techniques

In this project, our goal is to analyze, clean(if it's necessary ), prepare our data and finally predict the fuel consumption from a list of cars. The data set that we are going to use for our purpose is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository and you can find it in the link below: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg

At “building a model” section, I am going to apply 5 Supervised machine learning models: 1. Linear Regression, 2. Random Forest, 3. Ridge , 4.Lasso & 5. Elastic Net.
